Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10000
ii. Business table = 10000
iii. Category table =10000
iv. Checkin table =10000
v. elite_years table =10000
vi. friend table = 10000
vii. hours table = 10000
viii. photo table = 10000
ix. review table = 10000
x. tip table = 10000
xi. user table =10000
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = 10000 (Primary Key id is USED)
ii. Hours =	1562 (Foreign Key business_id is USED)
iii. Category =2643 (Foreign Key business_id is USED)
iv. Attribute =1115 (Foreign Key business_id is USED)
v. Review =8090 (Foreign Key business_id is USED), 9581 (Foreign Key user_id is USED)
vi. Checkin = 493(Foreign Key business_id is USED)
vii. Photo =10000 (Primary Key id is USED)
viii. Tip = 3979(Foreign Key business_id is USED) ,537 (Foreign Key user_id is USED)
ix. User = 10000 (Primary Key id is USED)
x. Friend = 11 (Foreign Key user_id is USED)
xi. Elite_years = 2780 (Foreign Key user_id is USED)

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.

We can observe the two groups both work on all days of the week.
We also observe that the Group 1 Shops are open for loger hours than the group 2 Shops.



ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?

Group 1:
+---------+-----------------+
| GRP     | NumberofReviews |
+---------+-----------------+
| group 1 |              42 |
+---------+-----------------+



Group 2:

+---------+-----------------+
| GRP     | NumberofReviews |
+---------+-----------------+
| group 2 |              96 |
+---------+-----------------+

We can see that group 2 has more number of reviews than group 1.

+----------------------+-------+---------+-----------------------+
We can observe the two groups both work on all days of the week.
We also observe that the Group 1 Shops are open for loger hours than the group 2 Shops.

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
+---------+-----------------+
| GRP     | NumberofReviews |
+---------+-----------------+
| group 1 |               1 |
+---------+-----------------+
+---------+-----------------+
| GRP     | NumberofReviews |
+---------+-----------------+
| group 2 |               6 |
+---------+-----------------+

We can see that group 2 has more number of reviews than group 1.


iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.

+--------------+---------+--------------------+
| neighborhood | GRP     | NumberOfBusinesses |
+--------------+---------+--------------------+
|              | group 1 |                  2 |

2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1: Star Ratings
	FOR OPEN BUSINESS:
+---------------+---------+
|    avg(stars) | is_open |
+---------------+---------+
| 3.67900943396 |       1 |
+---------------+---------+
	
	FOR CLOSED BUSINESS:
+---------------+---------+
|    avg(stars) | is_open |
+---------------+---------+
| 3.52039473684 |       0 |
+---------------+---------+

We observe that open businesses have a higher average star rating than closed businesses.
  
ii. Difference 2: Number of Reviews
+-------------+---------+
| count(text) | is_open |
+-------------+---------+
|         565 |       1 |
+-------------+---------+

+-------------+---------+
| count(text) | is_open |
+-------------+---------+
|          71 |       0 |
+-------------+---------+

We see that open businesses have more reviews than closed businesses.
         
         
SQL code used for analysis:

Difference 1:

Select avg(stars), is_open
FROM business
WHERE is_open = 1

Select avg(stars), is_open
FROM business
WHERE is_open = 0


Difference 2:

Select count(text),is_open
FROM business INNER JOIN review
ON business.id = review.business_id
WHERE is_open = 1

Select count(text),is_open
FROM business INNER JOIN review
ON business.id = review.business_id
WHERE is_open = 0
	
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:

  	The type of analysis I'm doing involves regression Analysis on the YELP Dataset.
  	The regression analysis I'm doing is on the Review Table of the dataset.
	This regression analysis is used for a prediction model.
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
    
	The data I'm using is the review table of the dataset. From there I took two variables 'cool' and 'useful.
   	The regression being done is to predict the usefullness value on the basis of the coolness. For this using pandas I imported the data
	Followed by that I set the X and Y variables. X = cool, Y = useful

	Then I observed the scatter plot of the two variables. Looking at the plot I observed that the type of Regression is linear.
	After making that observation I split my dataset into a training and testing data.
	Using scikit learn I applied the Linear Regression OLS model to the data set 
	Once the regression line was achieved I used the prediction algorithm on the test set and achieved a score of 0.788 (R^2) thus confirming that my code is correct.
	
       
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:

The entire dataset is huge and only some of it is shown.
         
         
iv. Provide the SQL code you used to create your final dataset:

SQL CODE FOR THE TABLE:

Select stars, useful
FROM review

Python Code For The Regression and Prediction Model:

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

sns.set()
data = pd.read_csv('yelp.csv')
data.head()
X = np.array(data['cool']).reshape(-1, 1)
Y = np.array(data['useful']).reshape(-1, 1)
plt.scatter(X,Y)
X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test = train_test_split(X, Y, test_size = 0.25)
reg = LinearRegression()
reg.fit(X_train, Y_train)
reg.score(X_test, Y_test)
y_pred = reg.predict(X_test)
plt.scatter(X_test, Y_test)
plt.plot(X_test,y_pred)
plt.show()
